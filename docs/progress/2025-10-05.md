# 2025-10-05 Progress Report

## Agent Worker API
- Added authenticated endpoints for `GET /api/user/me`, MCP link management, discovery proxying, and health checks in the Worker.
- Implemented session-aware chat, state retrieval, and interrupt endpoints backed by Prisma persistence.
- Introduced shared Worker utilities for bindings, Prisma lifecycle, JWT verification, and payload serialization.

## MCP Server Updates
- Registered a `/mcp/tools/:id/:toolName` proxy route with scope enforcement, status checks, and latency reporting.
- Wired the new tools router into the Worker entry alongside existing registry and discovery routers.

## Tooling & Configuration
- Extended `.dev.vars.example` with `JWT_SECRET` and optional `MCP_SERVICE_TOKEN` to support the new authentication flow.
- Verified builds for all workspaces via `npm run build`.

## Follow-Ups
- Replace the chat echo stub with the planned LangGraph orchestration and real MCP tool execution.
- Expand MCP tool proxy support for authenticated servers (API key / OAuth) and integrate streaming responses.
